Steps:

Download and save the "PL2303_64bit_ Installer.exe" by clicking here.
Unplug all USB-To-Serial adapters from your computer - and double-click on "PL2303_64bit_Installer.exe"
When it prompts you, plug in one (1) of your USB-To-Serial adapters and click "Continue".
Reboot your computer. That's it!


Troubleshooting:

You must follow ever step in the process in exact order.

If you still receive an error after running the PL-2303_64bit_Installer.exe and your device is plugged in - go to Windows Device Manager.

Windows Vista/7/8/10: Control Panel » System » Device Manager
Windows XP: Control Panel » System » "Hardware" tab » Device Manager
Scroll down to Ports (Com & LPT) and double-click on "Prolific USB-to-Serial Comm Port (COM#)".
In the Properties Window, Click on "Driver".
The "Driver Version" must say "3.3.2.102" dated 09/24/08.

If not, then the correct driver is not installed.

Unplug the USB-To-Serial adapter and run the "PL2303_64bit_Installer.exe" again - following the directions precisely until the correct driver appears.
